Optional: Files
When you’re doing data analysis, you won’t usually create a data frame yourself. Instead, you’ll import data from another source, such as  a .csv file, a relational database, or a software program. For this reason, it’s essential to be able to work with files in R. In this section, you’ll explore a few of the most useful functions for working with files, including commands to create, copy, and delete files in R. 

Create a file
Use the file.create() function to create a blank file. Place the name and the type of the file in the parentheses of the function. Your file types will usually be something like .txt, .docx, or .csv.

file.create("new_text_file.txt") 
file.create("new_word_file.docx") 
file.create("new_csv_file.csv") 

If the file is successfully created when you run the function, R will return a value of TRUE. Otherwise, R will return a value of FALSE. 


file.create("new_csv_file.csv")
# code output:
# [1] TRUE
Copy a file
Copy a file with the file.copy() function. In the parentheses, add the name of the file to be copied. Then, enter a comma, and add the name of the destination folder that you want to copy the file to. 


file.copy("new_text_file.txt", "destination_folder")
If you check the Files tab in RStudio, a copy of the file appears in the relevant folder:

You can delete R files with the unlink() function. Enter the file’s name in the parentheses of the function.


unlink("some_.file.csv")
You’ll learn techniques for importing files into R later in this course. 

Optional: Matrices 
A matrix is a two-dimensional collection of data elements. This means it has both rows and columns. By contrast, a vector is a one-dimensional sequence of data elements. But like vectors, matrices can only contain a single data type. For example, you can’t have both logicals and numerics in a matrix. 

To create a matrix in R, you can use the matrix() function. The matrix() function has two main arguments that you enter in the parentheses. First, add a vector. The vector contains the values you want to place in the matrix. Next, add at least one matrix dimension. You can choose to specify the number of rows or the number of columns by using the code nrow = or ncol =. 

For example, to create a 2x3 (two rows by three columns) matrix containing the values 3-8, enter a vector containing that series of numbers: c(3:8). Then, enter a comma. Finally, enter nrow = 2 to specify the number of rows. Run the code: 


matrix(c(3:8), nrow = 2)
Reset
R displays a matrix with three columns and two rows (typically referred to as a “2x3”) that contain the numeric values 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. R places the first value (3) of the vector in the uppermost row, and the leftmost column of the matrix, and continues the sequence from left to right. 

You can also choose to specify the number of columns (ncol = ) instead of the number of rows (nrow = ). Run the code: 


matrix(c(3:8), ncol = 2)
Reset
R infers the number of rows automatically.

Similar to data frames, you can extract an element from a matrix with the extract operator, [].
